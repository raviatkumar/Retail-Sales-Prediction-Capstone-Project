This repository includes the code and documentation for the Rossman Sales Prediction project. The objective of this project is to predict the daily sales of Rossmann stores for a future period of up to six weeks. Accurate sales forecasting enables store managers to make informed decisions related to promotions, competition, holidays, and other factors that impact sales performance.

# **Problem Statement**

###### **BUSINESS PROBLEM OVERVIEW**

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

# **Project Summary**

This project involves predicting the daily sales of Rossmann stores for an upcoming period of up to six weeks. With over 3,000 drug stores across 7 European countries, accurate sales forecasting is crucial for store managers to make informed decisions regarding promotions, competition, holidays, and various factors influencing sales performance. The provided historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores serves as the foundation for developing models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Evaluation metrics such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and Adjusted R2 showcase the models' exceptional performance on the testing data, with minimal error and high accuracy.
